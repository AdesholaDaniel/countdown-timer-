Just a simple project with vanilla.JS

This is simple self made project which I just built using the vanillaJS or simple JavaScript in other to get the no. of days and time function remaining for New year's eve.
The design for this project was gotten from an online free UI webssite. 
I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
